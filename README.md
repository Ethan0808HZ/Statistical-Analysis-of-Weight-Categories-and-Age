# Statistical-Analysis-of-Weight-Categories-and-Age
Project Overview
This project uses a comprehensive obesity dataset to investigate age distribution patterns across different obesity categories. Through data preprocessing, categorical grouping, one-way ANOVA, and Boxâ€“Cox transformation, it explores whether age significantly differs across various weight classifications, with post-hoc tests identifying where those differences lie.
